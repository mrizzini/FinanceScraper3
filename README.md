# FinanceScraper3
Web Scraper using C#

This app requires a user to create a profile in order to trigger a new "snapshot" of a mock Yahoo! Finance Portfolio of 11 stocks. It will give the user the real time data of their overall Portfolio, as well as real time data of the 11 stocks. This snapshot is created using Selenium, which scrapes the data right from the mock Yahoo Portfolio.

To help others test the code, the username and password for the mock Yahoo portfolio has been hardcoded into the Portfolio Service. When creating a new profile, it is not recommended that the user uses any of their real passwords.
